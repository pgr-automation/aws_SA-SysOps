# AWS CloudFront

AWS CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to users globally, with low latency and high transfer speeds. It caches content at edge locations worldwide, providing a fast, reliable way to distribute content.

---

## Key Features of AWS CloudFront

- **Global Content Distribution**: Distributes content through a global network of edge locations, reducing latency.
- **Security Integration**: Supports SSL/TLS encryption, AWS Shield, AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF), and field-level encryption for secure content delivery.
- **Dynamic and Static Content**: Delivers both static and dynamic content, including live streaming, on-demand video, web applications, and APIs.
- **Edge Computing**: Use AWS Lambda@Edge to run code closer to users, reducing latency for dynamic content and personalization.

---

## How AWS CloudFront Works

1. **Request Routing**: When a user requests content, CloudFront routes the request to the nearest edge location for fast delivery.
2. **Caching**: If the content is cached at the edge location, itâ€™s delivered immediately. If not, CloudFront retrieves the content from the origin server (e.g., S3 bucket, EC2, or a custom origin).
3. **Content Distribution**: CloudFront caches the content at the edge location to serve future requests faster.

---

## Common Use Cases

- **Static Website Hosting**: Serving static websites from Amazon S3 with reduced latency.
- **APIs and Web Applications**: Distributing dynamic content, APIs, and web applications for global users.
- **Live and On-Demand Video Streaming**: Delivering media content with minimal latency and buffering.

## Setting Up AWS CloudFront

### 1. Create a CloudFront Distribution

1. Open the **CloudFront** service in the AWS Management Console.
2. Click **Create Distribution** and choose **Web**.
3. Specify the **Origin Domain**:
   - For S3: Choose your S3 bucket.
   - For custom origin: Enter the URL of your EC2 instance, ALB, or other custom source.
4. Configure **Cache and Behavior Settings**:
   - Set up path patterns, caching behavior, viewer protocol policy, and allowed HTTP methods.
5. Choose **Price Class** based on the geographic regions to target.
6. Configure **SSL Certificate** if HTTPS is required.
7. **Create the Distribution** and note the generated CloudFront domain name (e.g., `dxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net`).

### 2. Point Your Domain to CloudFront

- To use a custom domain, create a CNAME record in Route 53 (or your DNS provider) that points your domain (e.g., `www.example.com`) to the CloudFront distribution domain.

### 3. Configure HTTPS (Optional)

- CloudFront supports HTTPS by default. To use HTTPS with a custom domain, attach an SSL certificate via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

## Example Use: Serving Content from S3

Once you set up CloudFront with an S3 bucket as the origin:

1. **Upload files** to your S3 bucket.
2. **Access content** via the CloudFront distribution URL (`https://dxxxxxxx.cloudfront.net/your-file.jpg`), which will cache and serve the content globally.

## Example AWS CLI Commands for CloudFront

To create a CloudFront distribution with the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws cloudfront create-distribution --origin-domain-name <bucket_name>.s3.amazonaws.com
```


# AWS CloudFront vs S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)

Both **AWS CloudFront** and **S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)** are used to improve content distribution and availability across regions. However, they serve different purposes and are optimized for different scenarios.

## Key Differences

| Feature                      | **AWS CloudFront**                                                                  | **S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**                                               |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                  | Distributes content globally with low latency by caching at edge locations.         | Copies objects between S3 buckets in different regions for disaster recovery and latency. |
| **Content Delivery**         | Primarily used for fast, global delivery of static and dynamic content.             | Ensures redundancy and regional availability for data stored in S3 buckets.            |
| **Data Storage**             | Caches content temporarily at edge locations (not permanent storage).               | Replicates content permanently between S3 buckets.                                     |
| **Latency Reduction**        | Reduces latency by delivering content from edge locations closest to users.         | Reduces latency for S3 read operations by replicating data closer to users in different regions. |
| **Use Case**                 | Ideal for websites, APIs, and media streaming.                                      | Best for disaster recovery, backup, and compliance requirements.                       |
| **Cost**                     | Charged per request and data transfer out from CloudFront.                          | Charged based on replication data transfer and storage costs in the target bucket.      |
| **Automatic Updates**        | Automatically caches content at edge locations but can require cache invalidation.  | Automatically replicates new or updated objects to the target bucket.                   |
| **Versioning Requirements**  | No specific requirements for versioning.                                            | Requires versioning enabled on both source and target S3 buckets.                      |
| **Security**                 | Supports SSL/TLS, AWS WAF, and custom SSL certificates.                             | Data replication can use AWS KMS for encryption.                                       |

## Use Cases

### AWS CloudFront
- **Fast Content Delivery**: Ideal for delivering static and dynamic content (e.g., websites, images, APIs) globally with low latency.
- **Media Streaming**: Supports video on-demand and live streaming with minimal buffering.
- **Web Application Acceleration**: Delivers both static assets and dynamic content quickly.
- **Edge Computing with Lambda@Edge**: Executes custom code at edge locations for personalized content and reduced server load.

### S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
- **Disaster Recovery**: Replicates data to another region to safeguard against regional outages.
- **Compliance and Backup**: Helps meet data residency requirements by storing data in multiple regions.
- **Data Distribution**: Reduces latency for read operations by placing data in regions closer to users.
- **Version Control**: Maintains a backup of each version of objects across regions when versioning is enabled.

---

## Choosing Between CloudFront and S3 Cross-Region Replication

- **Use CloudFront** when you need to deliver content quickly across a global network and don't need permanent storage at edge locations. It's ideal for websites, APIs, and streaming media that need fast, low-latency access.
  
- **Use S3 Cross-Region Replication** when you need permanent storage in multiple regions, either for backup, disaster recovery, or compliance. CRR is best suited for applications that need to keep copies of data in different regions.

---

## Example Scenarios

1. **Website Hosting with Global Reach**: Use **CloudFront** with an S3 origin to cache and serve static website assets globally, reducing load times for users worldwide.
2. **Backup and Compliance**: Use **S3 Cross-Region Replication** to replicate data from one S3 bucket to another in a different region for disaster recovery and compliance.
3. **API Acceleration**: Use **CloudFront** to cache API responses closer to users, improving response times for dynamic applications.

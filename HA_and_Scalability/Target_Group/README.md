# Targrt Group
- a Target Group is a resource that directs requests to specific targets, such as EC2 instances, IP addresses, or AWS Lambda functions. Itâ€™s primarily used with load balancers like the Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend resources.


# Setting Up a Production-Grade AWS Target Group

## Prerequisites
- AWS Account with required permissions.
- A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configured with subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
- Security group configurations to allow necessary traffic (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS).

---

## Step 1: Define the Target Group

1. Navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard** in the AWS Console.
2. In the left sidebar, under **Load Balancing**, click **Target Groups**.
3. Click **Create target group**.
4. Configure the **Target group settings**:

   - **Target type**: Choose `Instance` for instance-based targets or `IP` for IP-based targets (useful for external/non-EC2 resources).
   - **Target group name**: Choose a meaningful name (e.g., `prod-app-tg`).
   - **Protocol**: Select `HTTPS` for secure traffic, or `HTTP` if your application does not use SSL.
   - **Port**: Enter the port on which your application listens (e.g., `443` for HTTPS).
   - **VPC**: Select the VPC where your instances are hosted.

5. **Advanced Health Checks** (important for production):

   - **Protocol**: Set to `HTTPS` for security, if your application supports it.
   - **Path**: Define a custom health check endpoint (e.g., `/health` or `/status`).
   - **Port**: Use `Traffic port` to check the target's default listening port.
   - **Healthy threshold**: Set to `5` for production to avoid false positives.
   - **Unhealthy threshold**: Set to `2` for quicker failure detection.
   - **Timeout**: Set to a reasonable time (e.g., `5` seconds) based on application response time.
   - **Interval**: Adjust as necessary for your traffic needs (e.g., `30` seconds for stability).
   - **Success codes**: Define expected status codes (e.g., `200` for HTTP 200 OK).

6. Click **Create target group**.

## Step 2: Add Targets to the Target Group

1. After creating the target group, you will see an option to **Register targets**.
2. Select the EC2 instances or IPs that you want to add to this target group.
   - For high availability, ensure that instances are distributed across multiple Availability Zones.
3. Click **Include as pending below** and then **Register pending targets**.

## Step 3: Attach Target Group to an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

1. In the **Load Balancers** section, click **Create Load Balancer** and select **Application Load Balancer**.
2. Configure the ALB:
   - **Name**: Provide a unique name (e.g., `prod-app-alb`).
   - **Scheme**: Choose `Internet-facing` for public access or `Internal` for private access.
   - **Availability Zones**: Select subnets across multiple AZs for high availability.
3. **Listeners and Routing**:
   - Add an **HTTPS listener** for production security.
   - In **Default actions**, select **Forward to** and choose the target group created earlier.

4. **Security Settings**:
   - If using HTTPS, upload an SSL certificate for secure communications.
   - Select or configure a security group to allow traffic on required ports (e.g., `443` for HTTPS).

5. Click **Create load balancer**.

## Step 4: Configure Auto Scaling (Optional but Recommended for Production)

1. Go to the **Auto Scaling Groups** section in EC2.
2. Create or modify an Auto Scaling Group to use the target group created above.
   - **Health Checks**: Set to use both **EC2** and **ELB** health checks for thorough monitoring.
   - **Scaling Policies**: Configure scaling based on metrics like CPU utilization or request count to adjust capacity as demand changes.

---

## Step 5: Monitor and Adjust

1. **CloudWatch Alarms**: Set up alarms on target group metrics such as `UnhealthyHostCount` and `RequestCount` for proactive monitoring.
2. **Logging**: Enable access logging for the load balancer to capture request details.
3. **Alerts**: Set up notifications for health and scaling events to quickly respond to issues.

By following these steps, you can establish a robust, secure, and highly available Target Group configuration, suitable for production environments.



```
Step: 1 Create a target group
1. Create SG and allow port 80 or 443 to access only from ALB
2. Create EC2 Instance 
3. Create a target group 
 	Configure below:
 	- choose trget type
 	- Give targrt group name
 	- Select protocal with required port (http/https/tcp/udp/tls etc...)
 	- Select VPC
 	- Selet Protocal Version (HTTP1/HTTP2)
 	- Configure Health check if required
4. Register the targets with created EC2 instances. and configure instance port 
5. Include as pending below
6. Create

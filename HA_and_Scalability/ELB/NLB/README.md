# AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB)

The **AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB)** is designed to handle millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies. It operates at the connection level (Layer 4), routing TCP and UDP traffic to targets such as Amazon EC2 instances and containers. This document covers the use cases, features, and reasons to use NLB.

## Use Cases for Network Load Balancer (NLB)

1. **High Throughput Applications**
   - NLB can efficiently handle high volumes of incoming traffic, making it ideal for applications that require high throughput, such as gaming applications or video streaming.

2. **Real-Time Applications**
   - For applications requiring real-time data processing, such as voice-over-IP (VoIP) and online gaming, NLB's low-latency performance ensures minimal delay in communication.

3. **TCP/UDP Load Balancing**
   - NLB supports TCP and UDP traffic, making it suitable for applications that rely on these protocols, such as IoT applications, DNS servers, and database connections.

4. **Hybrid Environments**
   - NLB can be used in hybrid cloud environments where applications are running on both AWS and on-premises infrastructure, providing seamless integration and load balancing.

5. **WebSocket Support**
   - NLB supports WebSocket connections, which are essential for real-time web applications that require persistent connections, such as chat applications.

6. **Containerized Applications**
   - When deploying containerized applications on Amazon ECS or EKS, NLB can provide a stable endpoint and balance traffic to multiple container instances.

## Features of Network Load Balancer (NLB)

1. **Static IP Addresses**
   - NLB provides the option to assign static IP addresses to the load balancer, making it easier to configure DNS records and firewall rules.

2. **Elasticity and Scalability**
   - Automatically scales to handle increased traffic without manual intervention, ensuring high availability and reliability.

3. **Health Checks**
   - NLB performs health checks on registered targets to ensure traffic is only routed to healthy instances, improving application reliability.

4. **Integration with AWS Services**
   - NLB integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, including Amazon EC2, ECS, EKS, and AWS Global Accelerator, enhancing the overall architecture.

5. **TLS Termination**
   - Supports TLS termination, allowing NLB to handle encrypted traffic and offload SSL decryption from backend instances.

6. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Provides detailed logging and monitoring capabilities through AWS CloudWatch and access logs, enabling easier troubleshooting and performance monitoring.

## Why Use Network Load Balancer (NLB)?

1. **Performance**
   - With its ability to handle millions of requests per second with low latency, NLB is an excellent choice for high-performance applications.

2. **Protocol Support**
   - NLB supports both TCP and UDP protocols, making it versatile for a wide range of applications.

3. **Cost-Effectiveness**
   - NLB operates on a pay-as-you-go pricing model, which can be cost-effective for applications with variable traffic loads.

4. **Simplicity**
   - Easy to set up and manage through the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDKs, allowing teams to focus on application development rather than infrastructure management.

5. **Security**
   - NLB integrates with AWS security features such as security groups and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), providing a secure environment for applications.

6. **High Availability**
   - Distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets in multiple Availability Zones, ensuring fault tolerance and high availability for applications.

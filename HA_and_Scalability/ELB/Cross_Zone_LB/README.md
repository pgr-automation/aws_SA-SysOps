# Cross-Zone Load Balancing in AWS

**Cross-Zone Load Balancing** is a feature of AWS Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) that allows traffic to be distributed evenly across all registered targets in all enabled Availability Zones. This document covers use cases, features, reasons to use cross-zone load balancing, and setup instructions.

**ALB** - Enabled by Default (No charges)
**NLB & GWLB** - Disabled By Default (Additional cost if need to Enable)
    - Create: 
        - Go to LB -> select attributes -> Edit and Enable

## Use Cases for Cross-Zone Load Balancing

1. **High Availability Applications**
   - Cross-zone load balancing helps ensure high availability by distributing traffic evenly across multiple Availability Zones, reducing the risk of overloading a single zone.

2. **Fault Tolerance**
   - Applications that require fault tolerance can benefit from cross-zone load balancing, as it allows traffic to be rerouted to healthy instances in different zones in case of an outage.

3. **Scalable Web Applications**
   - Web applications with varying traffic loads can achieve better performance and resource utilization by evenly distributing incoming requests across multiple zones.

4. **Global Applications**
   - For applications deployed across multiple regions, cross-zone load balancing helps ensure that users receive a consistent experience regardless of their geographic location.

## Features of Cross-Zone Load Balancing

1. **Even Distribution of Traffic**
   - Cross-zone load balancing ensures that traffic is distributed evenly among all healthy targets in all enabled Availability Zones, preventing instances from becoming overwhelmed.

2. **Health Checks**
   - It integrates with health checks to ensure that traffic is only routed to healthy instances, enhancing the reliability of applications.

3. **Integration with Auto Scaling**
   - Works seamlessly with Auto Scaling groups, allowing new instances to automatically join the load balancing pool, ensuring optimal resource usage.

4. **Cost-Effective Resource Utilization**
   - By preventing over-provisioning in specific zones, cross-zone load balancing helps optimize costs associated with underutilized resources.

## Why Use Cross-Zone Load Balancing?

1. **Improved Performance**
   - By distributing traffic evenly, cross-zone load balancing enhances application performance and responsiveness, leading to a better user experience.

2. **Increased Resilience**
   - Provides a more resilient architecture that can withstand zone failures, improving overall application availability and reliability.

3. **Simplified Management**
   - Reduces the need for manual traffic management across different zones, simplifying application architecture and operational overhead.

4. **Optimal Resource Allocation**
   - Ensures efficient use of resources by preventing traffic concentration in specific zones, resulting in balanced load distribution.

   - In the left navigation pane, click on **Load Balancers**.

3. **Choose Your Load Balancer:**
   - Select the Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer you want to configure.

4. **Edit Attributes:**
   - Click on the **Description** tab, then choose **Edit attributes**.

5. **Enable Cross-Zone Load Balancing:**
   - Find the **Cross-Zone Load Balancing** option and check the box to enable it.

6. **Save Changes:**
   - Click **Save changes** to apply the settings.

### For Classic Load Balancer

1. **Open the Amazon EC2 Console:**
   - Navigate to the [EC2 Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

2. **Select Load Balancers:**
   - In the left navigation pane, click on **Load Balancers**.

3. **Choose Your Load Balancer:**
   - Select the Classic Load Balancer you want to configure.

4. **Edit Attributes:**
   - Click on the **Description** tab, then select **Edit load balancer attributes**.

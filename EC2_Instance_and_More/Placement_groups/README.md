# EC2 Placement Groups

EC2 placement groups allow you to control the placement of your EC2 instances for optimized networking performance or fault tolerance. This feature is particularly useful for applications that require low-latency, high-throughput communication between instances or for maximizing fault tolerance by spreading instances across distinct hardware.

## Types of Placement Groups

1. **Cluster Placement Group**
   - Instances are placed close together within a single Availability Zone (AZ) to achieve low-latency network performance.
   - Suitable for applications like high-performance computing (HPC), machine learning, and big data workloads.
   
2. **Spread Placement Group**
   - Instances are distributed across different hardware racks to reduce the risk of simultaneous failures.
   - Ideal for applications requiring high availability, such as replicated databases or microservices.

3. **Partition Placement Group**
   - Instances are divided into logical partitions, where each partition runs on a separate set of hardware racks.
   - Useful for large distributed systems like HDFS or Cassandra, where failure isolation is crucial.

## How to Set Up EC2 Placement Groups

### 1. Create a Placement Group

You can create a placement group using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs.

**AWS Management Console:**
- Navigate to **EC2 Dashboard** > **Placement Groups** > **Create placement group**.
- Provide a name, select a placement strategy (Cluster, Spread, Partition), and define the number of partitions if applicable.
- Click **Create**.

**AWS CLI:**
```bash
aws ec2 create-placement-group --group-name <group-name> --strategy <cluster|spread|partition> --partition-count <count>
```

### 2. Launch Instances in the Placement Group
    When launching EC2 instances, specify the placement group:

- AWS Management Console: Under Advanced Details during instance launch, select the placement group.
-  AWS CLI:
```bash
aws ec2 run-instances --placement "GroupName=<group-name>,AvailabilityZone=<AZ>"
```
 
### Use Cases

-Cluster Placement Group: Best for applications requiring high network throughput and low-latency communication, such as HPC workloads, batch processing, and machine learning.
- Spread Placement Group: Suitable for highly available applications like replicated databases, fault-tolerant applications, and microservices.
- Partition Placement Group: Ideal for distributed systems like HDFS, Cassandra, or HBase that require failure isolation and partitioning across hardware.
